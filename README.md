How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs can be very well represented as a list of plain requirements, but they do not convey the whole information on how such requirement should be developed. By creating user stories, such requirements are turned into a small phrase where the role of our possible user is recognized, what it is expected of the functionality to be implemented, and why doing so would solve a problem. This helps by giving a much richer idea on the purpose of the requirement, so it can be tailored according to the user needs, keeping in mind that such requirement is meant to solve a specific problem.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Although there are many methodologies to develop programs, agile has proven to be very efficient as it provides a much quicker response to feedback and change, focusing on delivering the best possible version of a product with the customers in mind. I hope that in my future development work I get to incorporate the Scrum framework and follow the processes seen in the course, especially the Daily Scrum meetings, as they seem to be a great tool to keep the whole team in constant communication to be aware of progress or any obstacles that may need attention.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe that a good team member is not only the one with the best set of coding skills, but also someone that is capable to work as a team, look at the project as a goal that the whole team shares, capable to step up when is needed, have good communication habits and also to be able to recognize their own mistakes and know that there is always space for improvement (embracing feedback from any source).
